# Practical comments

sec 1) Adopt A Well Status: Add the administrative information from the well service report in a text box. Plus Inauguration Day. It will complete the status summary;
sec 2) Adopt A Well Section looks good for the null case;
sec 3) Community Performance: I'm sure you will get the null case display correct;
sec 4) Financial Status looks as good as it can until we get some actual well costs;
sec 5) Well Services - THE FUNDERS INVESTMENT
... I would like to see the administrative information (well ID, name, department, commune etc), move to a new Status section(?), with the map and pie chart;
... I would like to see the Well Service Report, focus on just the well:

1. start date & finish date & completion depth
2. pump test date & flow rate
3. water quality date

Also, I'd like to see the 3 other Adopt-A-Wells included: Corail, Labich and Laveng.

A future graphic might focus on the cost/person vs actual cost.
