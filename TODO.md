## Ongoing, until end of contract on August 15, 2024

• Contribute to the overall development of the mWater database as a user-friendly portal for HANWASH
volunteers and staﬀ to easily access project data, regardless of whether it is the construction or the
operations period.
• Provide support as needed in planning and conducting the baseline study for the Mattson Program. If there is any issue that prevents the Contractor from completing the speciﬁc deliverables, for example a database is not well-constructed, or a survey hasn't been completed, or there is missing data, then the Contractor is responsible for clearly diagnosing the issue in writing so that it can be addressed promptly in collaboration with the HANWASH team. In addition, the Contractor is asked to proactively identify areas of potential value-added and propose/agree in writing on deliverables and timelines with the Executive Director or his delegated representative (i.e. the M&E Oﬃcer).

In the performance of the above activities, the Contractor will work closely with the M&E Oﬃcer to ensure that relevant stakeholders, especially Rotarians, are consistently engaged, informed, and consulted as work is conducted and given meaningful opportunities to lead and participate. Stakeholders include local
partners, HANWASH Ambassadors, Champion Districts and Champion Clubs, project managers, professional operators, the M&E Subcommi_ee, and the Executive Director. The Contractor will report to the Executive Director or their delegated representative(s) (i.e. the M&E Oﬃcer) and provide a short summary (maximum: 1 page) of activities/ observations/ challenges at least
once a month.
