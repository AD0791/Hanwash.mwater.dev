INDICATOR TYPE CLASSIFICATION - FINAL REPORT
=====================================================================================================

PROJECT: HANWASH Unified Indicators Database
DATE: November 24, 2025
TASK: Classify all indicators as either "evaluation indicator" or "monitoring indicator"

=====================================================================================================
CLASSIFICATION LOGIC
=====================================================================================================

The classification was performed using the following rules:

1. EVALUATION INDICATOR:
   - IF the indicator ID is found in the evaluation_indicators_with_ids.xlsx file
   - THEN assign "evaluation indicator"
   
2. MONITORING INDICATOR:
   - IF the indicator has an ID but is NOT in the evaluation indicators list
   - THEN assign "monitoring indicator"
   
3. EMPTY:
   - IF the indicator row has no ID (empty/null)
   - THEN leave the Indicator Type empty
   
Note: In this database, all 46 rows had valid IDs, so no empty types were assigned.

USAGE NOTES
=====================================================================================================

USING THE DATABASE:

1. FILTERING EVALUATION INDICATORS:
   - Filter "Indicator Type" column by "evaluation indicator"
   - This gives you the 26 indicators used for program evaluation

2. FILTERING MONITORING INDICATORS:
   - Filter "Indicator Type" column by "monitoring indicator"  
   - This gives you the 20 indicators used for ongoing monitoring

3. REPORTING:
   - Evaluation indicators: Used for formal evaluations, impact assessment
   - Monitoring indicators: Used for routine project monitoring, management decisions

4. DASHBOARD DESIGN:
   - Separate dashboards can be created for evaluation vs. monitoring
   - Or use the Indicator Type field to toggle between views

=====================================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
=====================================================================================================

✓ Database is now complete with indicator types assigned
✓ Ready for use in M&E framework implementation
✓ Can be integrated into monitoring dashboards
✓ Ready for data collection planning

Recommended actions:
1. Review the classification to ensure it meets your organizational needs
2. Share with M&E team for validation
3. Begin planning data collection systems for each indicator type
4. Design separate monitoring and evaluation reporting templates
